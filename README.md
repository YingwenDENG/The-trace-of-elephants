# The-trace-of-elephants
A group web mapping project about elephants in the parallax scrolling style.

We dedicate this web map to these captivating elephants and people who devote themselves to the elephant conservation and protection.

This map provides a brief introducion to the distribution of elephants in Aisa and Africa.
By hovering the mouse on different elephant markers, multilingual greetings are displayed on both distribution maps.
At the end of the website, a route which is composed of top safari parks for elephant appreciation in Africa is suggested.
